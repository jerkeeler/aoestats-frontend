          <p>
            These stats are derived from the developer APIs provided by{' '}
            <A to="https://aoe2.net">aoe2.net</A>. I would highly suggest
            checking out that website and supporting it! It is an awesome source
            of data! None of this would be possible without it.

        <Item question="Why do some stats look funky for 1650+?">
          <p>
            1650+ has a very limited number of games played. Thus the stats may
            look funky, especially when comparing win rate of one civ vs
            another. Short answer, not enough games! But I still wanted that
            bracket to look at high level stats.

        <Item question="What are the small percentage numbers everywhere?">
          Those values indicate how much a certain value has changed since the
          last patch. These indicate the <i>percentage change</i> of the value
          since that last patch. A 1% change of a 50% win rate{' '}
          <b>does not mean</b> the value went from 50% win rate to 51% win rate.
          It means it went from 50% to 50.5%.

          <p>
            Don't worry! The Voobly stats are still around! I'm still working on
            the best way for those stats to live in harmony with DE stats.
